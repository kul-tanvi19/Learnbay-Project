## Objective
To conduct an analysis to identify the factors that impact machine downtime, repair costs, and productivity.

## Datasource
Dataset contains approx. 178k rows and 45 number of columns. 

## Data Preparation and Analysis
Utilized SQL for data analysis and Power BI to create interactive data visualization report.
- Bellow are the questions to address :
    1. Analyze the Machines by their age and calculates the average number of breakdowns for each age group to see if older machines tend to break down more often.
    2. Identify the top 5 breakdown-prone machines and their associated downtime.
    3. Find the pattern of the cost impact of breakdowns by machine state.
    4. Identify the impact of machine location on breakdown frequency.
    5. compares the breakdown frequency of machines that underwent preventive maintenance against those that didn't, to assess the impact of maintenance on machine reliability.
